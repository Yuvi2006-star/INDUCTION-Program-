On the first day of college I felt proud to be a part of my second family “The GNDEC” . Me and my colleagues were welcomed by the Teachers and HOD’S along with the Principal Sir of our college . They enlightened us by saying that you are the future of our upcoming generation . We are the engineers which will make our earth beautiful with the help of our teachers as well as parents . The session begins with a brief introduction of our college. Our college started in 1956 with only one subject. After 70 years of the college we are with more than 7 subjects now . It happened because of the support of Nankana Sahib Education Trust because of its commitment to rural upliftment, and its contributions to technical education and research. After the brief introduction Some of the teachers addressed us.. One of them was Mrs Harpreet Kaur Grewal ..
